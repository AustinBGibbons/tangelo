Welcome to the Tangelo Web Framework!
=====================================

Tangelo is a general-purpose web server framework, built on top of CherryPy_.
Once it's set up, it stays out of your way, clearing the path for you to create
rich web applications using a mixture of HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and
other web technologies as you see fit.

To help in creating these applications, Tangelo exports the Tangelo API, which
exists as a collection of Python functions, JavaScript functions, and a set of
rules for creating flexible and powerful web services.  This document describes
all the pieces that fit together to make Tangelo work.

Please visit the `Tangelo homepage`_ or the `GitHub repository`_ for more
information.  Happy hacking!
